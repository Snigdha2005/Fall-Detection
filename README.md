@aruvi We are writing to seek your approval for our proposed project focused on implementing handwritten digit and character recognition.

# HANDWRITTEN DIGITS AND CHARACTERS RECOGNITION

In today's digitized world, there is a vast amount of handwritten data that requires efficient processing and analysis. Handwritten digit and character recognition systems play a crucial role in converting handwritten text into digital format, enabling automation in various industries such as finance, postal services, and document management. This project proposal aims to develop a robust and accurate handwritten digit and character recognition system using machine learning techniques.

## TechStack:

- Programming Language - Python
- Libraries - Tensorflow, PyTorch, OpenCV
- User Interface - Tkinter
